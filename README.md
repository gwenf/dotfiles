## Dot Files

I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for my vim plugins.

### VS Code Settings

- Font: I had to [install Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) on my system before I could use it as the default font-family and for font ligatures.

### Vim Plug Setup

1. Install Vim plug from the link above.
2. Open your `.vimrc` file in Vim (the file should be in your home directory).
3. Run this Vim command to install the packages: `:PlugInstall`
